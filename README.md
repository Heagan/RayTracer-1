# RayTracer

This is a re-upload of our WeThinkCode RayTracer project from 2017.

I wrote most of the RayTracer logic, and Alex Coetzee, my team mate for the
wrote file reading logic.

The reason why I re-uploaded this project, is because it was hoseted in a
private repo on Alex's gitHub.

To compile the program, you need SDL2, and Make installed on the system, then 
you simply run make all. Once the program has been compiled, you can run it
with:

./RT file_name

The scene files are saved in the scene_files folder.

This program has been tested on OSX, and Ubuntu.

Once and image has been displayed, you can save it by pressing the s key on the
keyboard.
