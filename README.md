# RayTracer

This is a re-upload of our WeThinkCode RayTracer project from 2017.

I wrote most of the RayTracer logic, and Alex Coetzee, my teammate for the
project wrote file reading logic.

The reason why I re-uploaded this project, is because it was hosted in a
private repo on Alex's GitHub.

Alexâ€™s GitHub is : https://github.com/AlexCoetzee

To compile the program, you need SDL2, and MakeFile installed on the system,
then you simply run make all. Once the program has been compiled, you can run it
with:

./RT file_name

The scene files are saved in the scene_files folder. My favorite scene is,
pretty_ball_on_a_plane.txt, I think it shows off the best parts of this
RayTracer.

Here's a lower res render of that scene: 

![PrettyBallOnAPlane](pretty_ball_on_a_plane.bmp)

This program has been tested on OSX, and Ubuntu.

Once and image has been displayed, you can save it by pressing the s key on the
keyboard.
